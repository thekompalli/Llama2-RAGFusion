Were there similar\\nstructures in onion peel cells?\\nThe nucleus has a double layered covering\\ncalled nuclear membrane. The nuclear\\nmembrane has pores which allow the transfer\\nof material from inside the nucleus to its\\noutside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we\\nwill talk about in section 5.2.4).\\nThe nucleus contains chromosomes,\\nwhich are visible as rod-shaped structures\\nonly when the cell is about to divide.\\nChromosomes contain information for\\ninheritance of characters from parents to next\\ngeneration in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\\nNucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are\\ncomposed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules\\ncontain the information necessary for\\nconstructing and organising cells. Functional\\nsegments of DNA are called genes. In a cell\\nwhich is not dividing, this DNA is present as\\npart of chromatin material. Chromatin\\nmaterial is visible as entangled mass of thread\\nlike structures. Whenever the cell is about to\\ndivide, the chromatin material gets organised\\ninto chromosomes.\\nThe nucleus plays a central role in cellular\\nreproduction, the process by which a single\\ncell divides and forms two new cells. It also\\nplays a crucial part, along with the\\nenvironment, in determining the way the cell\\nwill develop and what form it will exhibit at\\nmaturity, by directing the chemical activities\\nof the cell.\\nIn some organisms like bacteria, the\\nnuclear region of the cell may be poorly\\ndefined due to the absence of a nuclear\\nmembrane. Such an undefined nuclear region\\ncontaining only nucleic acids is called a\\nnucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack\\na nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes\\n(Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon\\n= nucleus). Organisms with cells having a\\nnuclear membrane are called eukaryotes.\\nProkaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack\\nmost of the other cytoplasmic organelles\\npresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the\\nfunctions of such organelles are also\\nperformed by poorly organised parts of the\\ncytoplasm (see section 5.2.4). The chlorophyll\\nin photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is\\nassociated with membranous vesicles (bag\\nlike structures) but not with plastids as in\\neukaryotic cells (see section 5.2.5).\\nRibosomes\\nPlasma\\nmembrane\\nCell wall\\nNucleoid\\nFig. 5.4: Prokaryotic cell\\n5.2.4 CYTOPLASM\\nWhen we look at the temporary mounts of\\nonion peel as well as human cheek cells, we\\ncan see a large region of each cell enclosed\\nby the cell membrane. This region takes up\\nvery little stain. It is called the cytoplasm.\\nThe cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the\\nplasma membrane. It also contains many\\nspecialised cell organelles. Each of these\\norganelles performs a specific function for the\\ncell.\\nCell organelles are enclosed by\\nmembranes. In prokaryotes, beside the\\nabsence of a defined nuclear region, the\\nmembrane-bound cell organelles are also\\nabsent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic\\ncells have nuclear membrane as well as\\nmembrane-enclosed organelles.\\nThe significance of membranes can be\\nillustrated with the example of viruses.\\nViruses lack any membranes and hence do\\nnot show characteristics of life until they enter\\na living body and use its cell machinery to\\nmultiply.\\n2020-21',\n",
